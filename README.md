# Generalised-Data-Structure-Library

- This Project is considered as a library which contains generic implementations of all major types of data structures such as Linked List, Stack and Queue.
- It provides the readymade implementations of all fundamental operations as well as advanced operations on linear, non-linear data structures in an object oriented way.
- It provides the generic way of implementation so we can use the functionality for any type of data types.
- All the object oriented design policies are used in this project.
